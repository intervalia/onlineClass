An online class system using socket.io

This started out as an exercise in learning socket.io. I ended up using it for several classes I taught at work.

It allows the teacher to post questions and see the answers of each student. Then the teacher can push all of the answers to all of the students.

It also allows the teacher to send code snipets (Mine focused on HTML and JavaScript) and URLs to the students browsers.
